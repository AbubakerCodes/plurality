# Plurality - CS50 Problem Set 3

This C program simulates an election using the plurality voting method, where each voter selects one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.

## How to Use

0. Install the CS50 library by following the instructions in the [CS50 Library GitHub repository](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50).
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the names of the candidates as command-line arguments.
3. Enter the number of voters.
4. For each voter, enter the name of the candidate they are voting for.
5. The program will calculate the winner of the election based on the candidate with the most votes.

## Example

$ ./plurality Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 3
Vote: Alice
Vote: Bob
Vote: Alice
Alice

In this example, there are three candidates (Alice, Bob, and Charlie) and three voters. The program calculates the winner based on the candidate with the most votes.

The program uses the plurality voting method, where each voter selects one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.
